# Implementation of a genetic algorithm in python

## Problem description: 
Implement an optimization algorithm that finds and prints the following sentence: 
*"Individuals and interactions over processes and tools"*

## Execution

    $> python App.py

## Program Input Values

When the program is executed, it is requested to enter the following information

    $> Enter the target text: 
    $> Enter number of individuals per population [100 to 300]: 
    $> Enter the mutation rate [0 to 1]: 

## Example

    $> Enter the target text: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools 
    $> Enter number of individuals per population [100 to 300]: 250
    $> Enter the mutation rate [0 to 1]: 0.85
